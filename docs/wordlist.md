# Wordlist filtering

We filter words to separate valid from invalid speech, we do it using specific lexicon dictionairies.

All the dictionnairies aggragated give us an approximate of 1,534,810 words. Which gives us a good coverage of the english language.
The ideal would be to use the Google Book's corpus with more that 2M words but it is not open-source (I think?).

### SCOWLv2 - ~676k words
